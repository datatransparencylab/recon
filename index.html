    <h3> What is Recon? </h3>
  <p class="description">
    Recon is one of the projects that is supported by the DTL Grants program. 
    It tries to provide users more transparency and control over the information
    about them that is sent by their mobile applications to Internet. 
    Currently, users install lot of applications on their smartphones, but
    these devices give them no visibility into what information is being sent,
    and who is receiving it, Recon solves this problem by providing users
    an additional level of monitoring and control on which data is sent and
    who is receiving it.
  </p>
    <h3> How does Recon work? </h3>
  <p class="description">
    Recon achieves this by analysing all the traffic that is sent by mobile
    devices and based on machine learning, it infers when privacy leaks occur
    based on contextual clues. This means that it detects when personal
    information is shared with other parties without users active involvement.
    The system has been trained with more than 1000 popular iOS and Android
    apps and it keeps learning continuously while people use it.
  </p>
    <h3> What type of information leaks detect Recon? </h3>
  <p class="description">
    The system looks for three main different categories of information:
  <ul class="description">
    <li><b>Personal Information:</b> Personal data such as name, gender, e-mail addresses, etc.</li>
    <li><b>Tracking Identifiers:</b> Identifiers that are used to uniquely identify a user. They could be hardware identifiers (e.g. IMEI) or software generated ones (e.g. AndroidID)</li>
    <li><b>Location Information:</b> Information about where users have been located.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
    <h3> How do I know where my information is sent? </h3>
  <p class="description">
    The system also divides the leakages into two main categories depending on
    whether the receiving party is a tracker or not. A tracker is a domain
    linked to companies that are known to track online activity of users at
    multiple domains so they can create profiles of the users. There are many
    public lists of trackers available, Recon has used the XXXX list to
    determine if a domain is a tracker or not.
    The reason for categorizing the receiving domains in these two categories
    (trackers/non-trackers) is because any leak that occurs to one of the
    tracker domains is more risky for end-users privacy, as trackers tend to
    accumulate different data from users and they can combine and exploit it
    in multiple ways.
  </p>
    <h3> Is there any way I can get what apps are leaking information?</h3>
  <p class="description">
    We have developed a <a href="tool.html"> tool</a> on top of the information gathered by Recon to
    make easier for anyone to understand which type of personal information is
    sent, which applications do it, and which are the domains that receive it.
    The tool allows to retrieve different types of insights, for the apps, 
    domains and information that is leaked.

  <p class="description">
    For instance, the following graph shows which iPhone Applications (from the ones
    analyised) are sending Location Information over the Internet to trackers.

  <p class="description">
    In the graph, for instance, we can see how by using the Facebook application,
    your location information is sent to 4 different trackers. We can also see
    how some of these trackers (e.g. advertising.com) are not receiving only 
    your location from Facebook but from other apps (e.g. Twitter in the example).
